# WarpPlugin
*A simple minecraft plugin that implements a simple /warp command.*

This was created because all the famous plugins come with unecessary features that slow down servers.
The plugin was created with 1.17.1 Spigot, so I can't ensure that everything will work properly if played
on older spigot versions, however it should work perfectly if used in Paper(still on newer versions, not on
older ones haha)



## Instalation

1. Download the plugin from [releases](https://github.com/Agentew04/WarpPlugin/releases/latest).
2. Drop the `.jar` in your server's plugins folder.
3. Start the server.
4. You're ready to go, enjoy the power of warps, without all the extra unecessary things in other plugins!

## Usage

- `/warps` => shows all the available warps.
- `/setwarp name` => creates a new warp with the specified name in the current player coordinates.
- `/delwarp name` => deletes any warp that has that name.
- `/warp name` => teleports the player to the desired warp
